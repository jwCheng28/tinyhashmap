# tinyhashmap
Hashmaps are a pretty convenient data structure, however as far as I know there isn't a standard library for any data structures in C.
Hence, the goal of tinyhashmap is to create a simply hashmap that may come in handy for future personal usage.

## Current Progress

### Completed
 - hashmap creation and destructor (no memory leaks)
 - hashing function
 - insert, get, and delete function

### In Progress
 - resize function
 - full testing code
